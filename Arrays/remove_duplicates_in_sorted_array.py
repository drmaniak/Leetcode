# ðŸ§© Problem: Remove All Duplicates Except One (Sorted Array)
#
#     Given a sorted array nums, modify it in-place such that each element appears at most once â€” but you must preserve the relative order of the unique elements. Return the new length of the array after duplicates are removed.
#     You must not allocate extra space â€” the operation must be done with O(1) extra memory.
#
# This is a soft twist on the original removeDuplicates problem â€” same core logic, new framing to deepen your grasp.

# âœ… Constraints
#
#     1 <= len(nums) <= 10^5
#
#     -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
#
#     nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
