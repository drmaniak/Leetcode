# ðŸ§© Problem: Longest Consecutive Sequence
#
#     Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence
#     of elements that can be formed.
#
#     A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater
#     than the previous element. The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.
#
#     You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

# âœ… Constraints
#
#     0 <= nums.length <= 1000
#     -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
