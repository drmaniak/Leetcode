# ðŸ§© Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
#
# ðŸ¤” Difficulty: Easy
#
#     You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of NeetCoin on the i-th day.
#
#     You may choose a single day to buy one NeetCoin and choose a different day in the future to sell it.
#
#     Return the maximum profit you can achieve. If no profit is possible, return 0.
#
#     Example 1:
#         Input:  prices = [10, 1, 5, 6, 7, 1]
#         Output: 6
#         Explanation: Buy at price[1] = 1, sell at price[4] = 7, profit = 6
#
#     Example 2:
#         Input:  prices = [10, 8, 7, 5, 2]
#         Output: 0
#         Explanation: No profitable transaction possible
#
# âœ… Constraints:
#     - 1 <= prices.length <= 100
#     - 0 <= prices[i] <= 100
