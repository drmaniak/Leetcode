# ðŸ§© Problem: Koko Eating Bananas
#
# ðŸ¤” Difficulty: Medium
#
# ðŸ”— Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas
#
#     You are given an integer array `piles` where `piles[i]` is the number of bananas in the ith pile.
#     You are also given an integer `h`, the total number of hours you have to eat all the bananas.
#
#     You may decide your bananas-per-hour eating rate `k`.
#     Each hour, you may choose any pile and eat up to `k` bananas from it.
#     If the pile has less than `k` bananas, you eat the entire pile and cannot continue to another in the same hour.
#
#     Return the **minimum integer `k`** such that Koko can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.
#
#     Example 1:
#         Input:  piles = [1, 4, 3, 2], h = 9
#         Output: 2
#
#     Example 2:
#         Input:  piles = [25, 10, 23, 4], h = 4
#         Output: 25
#
# âœ… Constraints:
#     - 1 <= piles.length <= 1000
#     - piles.length <= h <= 1_000_000
#     - 1 <= piles[i] <= 1_000_000_000
