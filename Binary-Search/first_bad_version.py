# ðŸ§© Problem: First Bad Version
#
# ðŸ¤” Difficulty: Easy
#
# ðŸ”— Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version
#
#     You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
#     Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
#     Since each version is developed based on the previous one, all versions after a bad version are also bad.
#
#     You are given an API `isBadVersion(version)` which returns True if a version is bad.
#     Implement a function to find the first bad version.
#     You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
#
#     Example 1:
#         Input:  n = 5, bad = 4
#         Output: 4
#         Explanation:
#             call isBadVersion(3) -> False
#             call isBadVersion(5) -> True
#             call isBadVersion(4) -> True
#
#     Example 2:
#         Input:  n = 1, bad = 1
#         Output: 1
#
# âœ… Constraints:
#     - 1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1
