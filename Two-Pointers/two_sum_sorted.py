# ğŸ§© Problem: Two Integer Sum II
#
#     Given an array of integers numbers that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
#
#     Return the indices (1-indexed) of two numbers, [index1, index2], such that they add up to a given
#     target number target and index1 < index2. Note that index1 and index2 cannot be equal,
#     therefore you may not use the same element twice.
#
#     There will always be exactly one valid solution.
#
#     Your solution must use O(1) additional space.

# âœ… Constraints
#
#     2 <= numbers.length <= 1000
#     -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
#     -1000 <= target <= 1000
