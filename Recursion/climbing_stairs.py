# ðŸ§© Problem: Climbing Stairs
#
# ðŸ¤” Difficulty: Easy
#
#     You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
#     Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.
#     In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
#
#     Example 1:
#     Input: n = 2
#     Output: 2
#     Explanation:
#         1 step + 1 step
#         2 steps
#
#     Example 2:
#     Input: n = 3
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation:
#         1 + 1 + 1
#         1 + 2
#         2 + 1
#
# âœ… Constraints:
#     1 <= n <= 45
